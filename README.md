## 📝 Important Notes for PDF Generation

### Local Development vs Production
This project uses **api2pdf** for high-fidelity PDF generation, which renders the resume via a real Chrome instance in the cloud.

- **In Production & Local**: PDF generation works consistently via the api2pdf API.
- **Requirements**: You must have a valid `API2PDF_KEY` in your `.env` file.
